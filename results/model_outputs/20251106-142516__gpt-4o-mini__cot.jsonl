The move from C3 to F6 is a diagonal move.\n2. **Calculating the Move**: \n   - Starting from C3, the piece moves diagonally to F6.\n   - The squares involved are C3 (starting), D4, E5, and F6 (ending).\n   - This is a valid diagonal move as it covers three squares diagonally.\n\nSince the move from C3 to F6 is a valid diagonal move, it is legal under the variant rules.\n\nFinal Answer: A", "parsed_choice": "A", "correct_choice": "A", "is_correct": true, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 127, "completion_tokens": 153, "total_tokens": 280}}
